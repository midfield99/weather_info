#Note, this validation approach isn't entirely accurate.
# It should allow nearly all cities,
# but I have found some cities with special characters.
# But this method is simple.
#
# I also checked a couple cities with abbreviations (like Ft. Worth)
# and it looks like the api returns 404s with some common abbreviations.
# So I'm ok not accepting abbreviations or periods.
#
# I'm also not implementing spell check.

#Note, the state is intentionally ignored.
# I've checked the API documentation and it doesn't look like there is an endpoint for a city/state pair.
# Just city/country. This will cause issues, for instance a lot of states have a city Riverside.
#
# I've also checked temps on the site via the search bar, multiple results can be returned,
# but again it looks like adding a state does not change ordering. Riverside,Iowa and Riverside,California
# both returned the same results in the same order.
# It looks like the api endpoint just returns the first item in that list.
# 
# using a zip code to retrieve temperatures would probably be much more accurate.
